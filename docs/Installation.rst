External dependencies

The following external software is used by ETSimulations and should thus be installed first:

* Chimera - https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/

* TEM-simulator - http://tem-simulator.sourceforge.net/

* Python 3.3 or greater

------------------------
Setting up ETSimulations
------------------------
To begin, navigate to a directory in which you want to install the package and run the following commands::

    git clone https://github.com/kmshin1397/ETSimulations.git

    cd ETSimulations

    python3 -m venv env

    source env/bin/activate

    pip install -r requirements.txt


This will have downloaded the ETSimulations code and set up the necessary Python packages and environment.
