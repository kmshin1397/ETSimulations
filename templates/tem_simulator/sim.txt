=== simulation ===

# The simulation component specifies what kind of computations should be done.
# These input parameters indicate that a set of micrographs should be 
# generated.

generate_micrographs = yes

# A log file is saved showing all input parameters and which steps of the
# simulation have been completed. The format of the log file is such that
# it can be used as input in another simulation.

log_file = simulator.log

=== sample ===

# The sample component specifies the overall shape of the sample. The sample 
# consists of a number of particles embedded in ice and sits in a circular 
# hole in a supporting film. The diameter of the hole and the thickness of 
# the ice at the center and at the edge of the hole are given in nanometer.

diameter = 10000

=== geometry ===

# The geometry component specifies how the sample is rotated in each image 
# of the tilt series.
#
# A simple tilt series with rotations around a single axis can be specified
# by the parameters tilt_axis, theta_start and theta_incr.
# More complicated tilt series can be generated by reading the Euler angles of 
# each image from a file instead.

gen_tilt_data = yes

# The tilt series has 36 images. The tilt angle starts at -54 degrees
# and increases 3 degrees between each image. By default, the x-axis is
# used as tilt axis. This can be changed by assigning the parameter tilt_axis.

ntilts = 37

# It is possible to include various errors in the tilt angles and the alignment.
# The errors can either be generated randomly or read from a text file. In this 
# simulation no geometry errors are used.

# In this simulation the acceleration voltage is 300 kV and the energy spread 
# of the beam is 1.3 eV.

# In this simulation, the electron dose in each image is generated from a few
# parameters. The total dose of 6000 electrons per square nanometer is equally
# distributed over all the images.

=== optics ===

# The optics component specifies the properties of the optical system.
#
# The magnification is 53000 times. The spherical aberration cs, and the
# chromatic aberration cc are in mm. The diameter of the aperture in the
# focal plane is in micrometer, and the focal length of the primary lens
# is in mm. The aperture angle of the condenser lens is in milliradian.

# given i micrometer, and positive values means underfocus.

=== detector ===

# A specification of the detector is the last component needed to simulate 
# micrographs.
#
# Here a 2000 x 2000 pixel detector area is simulated.

det_pix_y = 2000

# The physical size of the detector pixels is 16 micrometer.

# The gain is the average number of counts in the readout generated by each 
# electron that strikes the detector. Changing the gain does not change the
# quality of the images, but can be useful to mimic the output from a particular
# real detector.

gain = 10000

# A realistic simulation should use quantization of the electron detection, as
# this is the dominating source of noise in real micrographs. Removing this 
# source of noise can sometimes be useful, for example to check that the 
# simulation is set up correctly.

use_quantization = yes

# The detector quantum efficiency is a number between 0 and 1. An ideal detector
# would have DQE = 1.

# The MTF parameters control the blurring of the image as it is transferred from
# the scintillator to the actual detector, such as a CCD.

# The images are all written to a single MRC file called tiltseries.mrc

image_file_out = /data/kshin/T4SS_sim/c4/simulated_tiltseries_21/T4SS_C4_0.mrc

=== detector ===

# For reference, it is useful to also save a second series of unrealistically
# noise free images. This can be accomplished by using a second detector 
# component with use_quantization set to no.
